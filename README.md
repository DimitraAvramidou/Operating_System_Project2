It is about a program,which creates more than one processes whose purpose is to record the movements of text pieces sent and received by 
them. The data are transmitted through another process that communicates with each of them by using shared memory.Synchronization of 
processes when accessing shared memory,is achieved by using semaphores that prevent simultaneous access to data in more than one processes.
